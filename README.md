# Personal Website

The above mentioned files, are the components in order to render my personal website using Github and Rmarkdown.   

The code in the files is in R, but there is also extensive use of html to configure font and alignment of the text.

All the files of this project are saved in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stsentemeidis/personal-site).

The work is done by the Stavros Tsentemeidis student of the IE MBD '18 intake and any work copied from this repository should cite the following:
